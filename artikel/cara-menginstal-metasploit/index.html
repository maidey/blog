Post-install message from rubyzip:
RubyZip 3.0 is coming!</p>
<hr>
<p>The public API of some Rubyzip classes has been modernized to use named
parameters for optional arguments. Please check your usage of the
following classes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Zip::File</code></li>
<li><code>Zip::Entry</code></li>
<li><code>Zip::InputStream</code></li>
<li><code>Zip::OutputStream</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Please ensure that your Gemfiles and .gemspecs are suitably restrictive
to avoid an unexpected breakage when 3.0 is released (e.g. ~&gt; 2.3.0).
See <a class="link" href="https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip"  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
    >https://github.com/rubyzip/rubyzip</a> for details. The Changelog also
lists other enhancements and bugfixes that have been implemented since
version 2.3.0.
